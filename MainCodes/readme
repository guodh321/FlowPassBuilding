1. to compile the fortran library for python to use (u2r is the library):
python3 -m numpy.f2py -c unstruc_mesh_2_regular_grid_new.f90 -m u2r

#old way
#f2py -c unstruc_mesh_2_regular_grid_new.f90 -m u2r

2. to run the interpolation test (needs vtktools.py):
python3 interpolation.py

to compile fortran library in fortran (probably won't need this):
gfortran -fdefault-real-8 -o unstruc_mesh_2_regular_grid_new unstruc_mesh_2_regular_grid_new.f90
